//! This code is directly copied from https://github.com/Ralith/lahar/tree/fbc889a4538e2d3b6b519a6cb7a3538d7b3bfcdf
//! with minor modifications for interoperability with the current versions of ash and lahar. It is intended to be temporary
//! and will be replaced when the code is sufficiently refactored to support the newer lahar structures.
